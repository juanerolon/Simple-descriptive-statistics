# Simple Descriptive Statistics with Python

Collection of individual scripts and ipython notebooks illustrating basic application of python to compute simple statistics. Intended for students enrolled in an introductory course in statistics.

## Installation

Fork or clone GitHub repository and make sure you have a working Python 3 installation. To get the most of the scripts, make sure you have Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries installed in your Python environment.  The easiest way to add the required libraries is by using the tools provided by the Anaconda python distribution, https://www.anaconda.com.

`$ git clone https://github.com/juanerolon/Simple-descriptive-statistics.git`

**Manual installation within a conda environment (if libraries not already present):**

`$ conda install numpy`  

`$ conda install scipy`  

`$ conda install matplotlib`  

`$ conda install pandas`

## Usage

To run code inside Ipython notebooks you may open the file using Jupyter. From the command line:

`$ jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`

To run each individual script you may use your favorite IDE or run the script from the command line:

`$ python scriptname.py`
